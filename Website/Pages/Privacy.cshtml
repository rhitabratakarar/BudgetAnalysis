<p>Review this page to understand how the application is responsible to collect your data.</p>
<hr />

<div>
    <h4 class="">1. Overview</h4>
    <p>This Budget Analyser web application is intended to be self-hosted and managed entirely by the user. As the developer, I (the creator) do not collect, process, or store any user data. You, the user, are solely responsible for deploying, configuring, and operating the application in your own environment.</p>
    
    <h4 class="">2. Data Collection</h4>
    <p>
        This application does not collect any personal data on its own.

        All data used or stored by the application (e.g., Budget information from Google Sheets, or data stored in a local SQL Server database) is entirely managed and owned by the user.
    </p>

    <h4 class="">3. User Accounts</h4>
    <p>
        The application does not support user registration or login functionality by default.

        No credentials or user profiles are stored or processed by the application itself.
    </p>
    
    <h4 class="">4. Data Storage</h4>
    <p>
        Data may be stored in:

        A local SQL Server database on the user's machine or server.

        Google Sheets, linked by the user via their own credentials or API configuration.

        I do not have access to any of this data, nor is it transmitted to any external servers under my control.
    </p>

    <h4 class="">5. Cookies and Tracking</h4>
    <p>
        The application may use cookies for essential functionality (such as maintaining session state).

        No third-party analytics (e.g., Google Analytics) are integrated.

        Users are encouraged to update the cookie policy or banner if they extend the app or host it publicly.
    </p>

    <h4 class="">6. Data Security</h4>
    <p>
        The application is intended to be run in a local or self-hosted environment.

        HTTPS needs to be configured by the user (a local SSL certificate works for dev purposes).

        It is your responsibility to secure your data and environment as per your own privacy and security needs.
    </p>

    <h4 class="">7. User Rights</h4>
    <p>
        Since no data is collected by the developer, all control remains with the user.

        Users are responsible for managing, updating, and deleting their own data.
    </p>

    <h4 class="">8. Compliance with Privacy Laws</h4>
    <p>The application does not actively process any personal data and is designed to be run in personal environments.</p>

    <h4 class="">9. Changes to This Policy</h4>
    <p>This policy is subject to change if the application evolves. Since you’re hosting and managing it, you’ll want to update your own copy of this policy to reflect any modifications or added features (like logging or analytics).</p>
    
    <h4 class="">10. Contact</h4>
    <p>If you have questions about the application or this policy, feel free to reach out to me via Email or Github, whatever seems suitable for you (find the information in Wiki page)</p>
